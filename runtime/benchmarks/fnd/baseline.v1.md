# FND algorithm baseline v1

This artifact records bounded current and historical-reference observations.
Every row is informational: no result is a performance threshold or gate.
Generated inputs are synthetic and created only for the benchmark process.

## Assessment notes

- `csv_scheduler_progress_scan`: Array.shift queue movement and full progress-map scans have quadratic operation counts; the prior audit observed about 35/112/392 ms at 8k/16k/32k items.
- `patch_delete_parser_historical_comparison`: Historical comparison only: artifact commit 3431a40ea, bound to source revision 925f3ec2860abf48e0c6c0830d135da2587a4d69 (JSON SHA-256 8c72fc88fd10dfde2f91bd7cc3ce8028af552781b7b699db9931529cac0abd07), recorded a 355.764281 ms median for 32,000 delete hunks while the old parser repeatedly sliced the unconsumed suffix. Current production advances line indices without suffix slicing; this case replays the same generated workload and is not a performance threshold.

## Reproduce

Run on the same pinned runtime and machine state; compare medians, MAD,
operation counts, and relative scaling rather than one wall-clock sample.

```sh
npm run benchmark:fnd-baseline --workspace=@tetsuo-ai/runtime -- --source-revision a5517b45ae93dce96a23079816b71bc8bd0f2169 --output /tmp/agenc-fnd-baseline.v1.json --markdown-output /tmp/agenc-fnd-baseline.v1.md
npm run check:fnd-benchmark-baseline --workspace=@tetsuo-ai/runtime
```

Completed workers report their actual process high-water RSS from
`process.resourceUsage().maxRSS`, normalized from KiB to bytes. A worker
terminated during synchronous work cannot emit that final high-water mark,
so its peak is `n/a`; its last start RSS remains a clearly labeled lower
bound. Endpoint observations are retained as diagnostics and are never
presented as the worker peak.
